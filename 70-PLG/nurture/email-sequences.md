| **Spacing** | 24px between sections, 40px before CTA |

### Illustration Themes

Each sequence has a visual story arc:

| Sequence | Visual Theme | Illustration Style |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Welcome & First Data | **Journey begins** | Rocket launch, open door, sunrise |
| Aha Activation | **Discovery moment** | Lightbulb, magnifying glass, treasure |

| `INSIGHT_COUNT` | Number | Daily sync |
| `TASK_COMPLETED_COUNT` | Number | Daily sync |

## Metrics & Optimization

### Target Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Industry Avg |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Welcome email open rate | 50%+ | 40% |
| Sequence open rate | 35%+ | 25% |
| Click-through rate | 8%+ | 3-5% |
| Unsubscribe rate | <0.5% | 0.5% |
| Trial conversion | 25%+ | 15-20% |

### A/B Testing Priorities

1. **Subject lines**: Test personalization vs. benefit-led
2. **Send times**: 10am vs. 2pm local time
3. **CTA copy**: Action verbs vs. benefit statements
4. **Email length**: Short (100 words) vs. detailed (300 words)
5. **Hero images**: Illustrations vs. product screenshots

### Weekly Review Checklist

- [ ] Check open rates by sequence
- [ ] Review click-through rates by CTA
- [ ] Monitor unsubscribe rate (flag if >0.5%)
- [ ] Analyze conversion funnel dropoff
- [ ] Update cohort definitions if needed
